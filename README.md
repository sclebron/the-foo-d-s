## Description

 Resturant Rating App for Individual Meals.

 Our task is to create a simple application that allows a user to provide a review of their favorite meals at resturants that may not have received high ratings for their overall menus.  This application will act as a messageboard for promoting great meals at resturants that users may have overlooked because of the lower overall resturant rating.

 This application will use...........databases to provide updated user reviews.

## Installation

 npm install

## Issues

 There are no issues at this time. 

## User Story

 AS an average Joe with a favorite meal at a hole in the wall resturant
 <br/>
 I WANT to share my review with as many other people as possible
 <br/>
 SO THAT I can get the word out about this resturant and discover resturants with great meals from other users reviews
 <br/>

## Acceptance Criteria

 GIVEN I am using the application "The Fair Fare"
 <br/>
 WHEN I open the application
 <br/>
 THEN the webpage is displayed in the browser 
 <br/>
 WHEN I click on the Login/register button
 <br/>
 THEN I am presented with a Login/Register form 
 <br/>
 WHEN I enter my username and password in the Register form
 <br/>
 THEN I am logged in directed back to the webpage
 <br/>
 WHEN I click on the Category Selector button
 <br/>
 THEN I am presented with a list of resturants types
 <br/>
 WHEN I click on a resturant type
 <br/>
 THEN I am presented with multiple cards, each representing a local resturant and an image of their signature meal
 <br/>
 WHEN I click on a resturant card
 <br/>
 THEN I am presented with the resturant's rating and number of reviews, and the meal's rating and number of reviews
 <br/>
 WHEN I click on a specific meal
 <br/>
 THEN I am presented with a form to add my own review for that meal
 <br/>
 WHEN I complete my review and submit
 <br/>
 THEN my review is added to the database for other users to view 

## Usage

Once you've opened the webpage and are logged in, you can select types of local resturants from a list.  After you select a resturant type, you'll see a display of one or more resturants.  Each resturant will be displayed with its overall rating, and its best meal with its individual rating.  You can simply use the app to find highly rated meals at resturants that you would have overlooked, due to the resturants overall rating.  You can also add your own review of a resturants meal.  Your review will be added to the database to help other people find a great meal.
